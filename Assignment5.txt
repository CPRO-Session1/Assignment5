1.

int a; 
ifloat b;
int c; 
fxn(a,b,c)
----------
This is how I would call the code, assuming a,b and c are not global variables.

2. Recursion is when a function calls itself, while iteration is when one uses loops. Recursion is easier to think 
   about, and also more "mathematically neat". On the other hand, loops are more efficient. One can first answer 
   a problem statement using recursion, then rewrite it using loops. Recursion also takes more memory. 

3.A compiler is a program that translates code written in high level language into machine code for the computer
  to execute. It also helps the programmer write their code without syntax errors etc. by pointing out 
  errors.
