1) calling that function would look something like
	fxn(x,y,z);
	this is assuming that x y and z are all int data types adn have been initialized and everything else is declared;
	You dont need to put an int in the parameter because that would be like put int a = int x; which is wrong you would
	put int a = x; which is what the parameter is doing.

2) iteration is a loop for/while statement. one iteration is one loop through, recursion is calling a function x in function x to get a loop.
   recurison is iteration for functions. recursion is sometimes better than iteration because it is makes for more organized code, it can be
   easier to code a loop in recursion, and it can better more efficent. Recursion is worse in most cases as it takes up much for memory than iteration.

3)A compiler translates one code into another. From what i understand and from the slides is that it turns the source code into some lower level language
or binary then it adds the library refence into the lower level language then creates an executable.
