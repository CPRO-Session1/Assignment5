1. One way to do it is:
int main(){
	int execute;
	execute = fxn(3, 4.55, 6);
	return 0;
}
The execute variable is used to call the function.
3, 4.55 and 6 are all numbers to pass the parameters set by the function.

2. Differences between recursion and iteration
- A recursion uses more memory than iteration
- Recursions make the solution more elegant and readable than an interation
- Recursive functions are less efficient than loops because it takes longer
- Recursive functions have a 'base case' to determine where to stop recursing, while iterations do not
- recursive functions can always become iterative ones, but not all iterations are recursions

3. A compiler converts a program from a human-readable format into a machine-readable format. It does this by translating the source code from a programming language into executable code.
