1) To call the function, it would look like this:

    /* Misc stuff above the main function, including functions, function
    * declarations, header statements (like #define and #include), and stuff
    */
    int main(){
        /* we need 2 ints and 1 float to pass to the function. */
        int a = 6;
        float b = 0.5;
        int c = 2;
        /* the function returns an integer value */
        printf("%d\n", fxn(a, b, c));
    }
    /* Misc stuff after the main function */

2) Looping is usually better, as it doesn't require the computer to store the previous
iterations in memory. Recursion would be preferable for things like trees, where it
needs to go down more than one path.

3) no idea.
