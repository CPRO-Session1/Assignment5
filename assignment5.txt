1. I would call it by doing printf("%d", fxn(1, 2.0, 3));

I would do it like this as I want to see what I am returning as well so that the parameters match the specific
type the function wants.

2. Recursion is where the function calls itself. While iteration is repetition of the process.
Adv of Recursion:
  Less code written
Disadv of recursion:
  Recursion is slower
  Uses more memory
  Iteration is more efficient.
Recursion is bad when the programs are not recursive in nature. This is because it will lead to waste of memory
and inefficiency.

Step:
1. Lexing - where the text is broken up into 'tokens'
2. Parsing - Converting these tokens into a parse tree.
3. Optimization: evaluate constant expressions, unroll loops if possible (optimize the code in short)
4. Translate this parse tree into machine instructions.
