# Assignment5
## Objectives
To gain experience writing functions and using recursion.

### Part 1
1.  Write a program, `recurseFibonacci.c`, that uses a recursive function to print the first K Fibonacci numbers in sequence.  In the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the 2 before it.  The first 2 numbers in the sequence are 1.

2.  In a separate program, `loopFibonacci.c`, write the same Fibonacci sequence as a loop.


### Part 2

In a text file `assignment5.txt`, answer the following questions:
1.  How would you call the following function?  Give an example of what it would look like written inside of the main() function and explain your code in detail.
  
```
	int fxn(int a, float b, int c)
```

2.  Explain the difference between recursion and iteration.  When/why is one preferable over the other?  Why is recursion worse in other cases?

3.  How does a compiler work?  Explain step by step.


### Submission Guidelines
